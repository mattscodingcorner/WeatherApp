## Description

This site will provide a 5 day weather forecast for any city you search for. It will include the Tempature, the wind speed, and short description of the weather. 

- Movitvation for building this site was to become more comfortable using server API's and storing data client side. 
- This project is another way to search for the weather in which ever city you can think of. 
- I learned a lot about the OpenWeather API along with a lot more JavaScript and BootStrap
